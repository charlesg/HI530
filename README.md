# Computational Methods in Health Informatics

My project around the HI 530 course - Computational Methods in Health Informatics offered in the College of Business Management at SUNY Polytechnic Institite.

The course is based on the book "Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts, Techniques and Applications in Python" (https://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Business-Analytics-Applications/dp/1119549841). The book has an R version also but this work was done using the Python version.
